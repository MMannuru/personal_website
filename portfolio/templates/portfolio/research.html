        I believe that research is the most rewarding part of science. It allows us to explore unknowns, challenge existing boundaries, and create solutions to complex problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        So far, I've been able to explore some incredibly fascinating problems in AI, machine learning, mechanics, and computational biology.

    <!-- Project 1 -->
    <div class="project">
        <h3 style="color: #50fa7b;">Inverse Design of Non-linear Mechanical Metamaterials with Generative AI</h3>
        <p>
            What are metamaterials?
        </p>

            <img src="{% static 'portfolio/meta.jpg' %}" alt="Description of the image" style="width: 600px; height: 300px; border-radius: 10px;">
        </div>
        <p>
            Metamaterials are cutting-edge engineered structures that exhibit extraordinary properties, such as the ability to bend light or absorb sound, which are impossible with conventional materials. They hold the potential to revolutionize fields like advanced manufacturing, aerospace, and robotics. However, designing these materials is a highly complex process due to their intricate geometries and the nonlinear mechanical behaviors they exhibit under various conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditional deep learning methods fall short when it comes to predicting these complex behaviors because they often rely on simplified stress-strain data, which do not fully capture the intricate deformation patterns within the material.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to tackle this challenge by training generative models on detailed internal stresses and displacement fields. This enables our models to learn deep, underlying non-linear mechanical relationship and predict microstructures with unique properties.

    <!-- Project 2 -->
    <div class="project">
        <h3 style="color: #50fa7b;">Automating 3D Point Cloud Object Classification Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
            What is point cloud classification?
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
            <img src="{% static 'portfolio/cloud.jpg' %}" alt="Description of the image" style="width: 600px; height: 300px; border-radius: 10px;">
        </div>
        <p>
            Point cloud object classification is the process of identifying and labeling 3D objects from a set of points in space. These points are typically generated by sensors like LiDAR. Unlike traditional ML/DL methods that work on structured data like images or text, point clouds are unstructured, irregular, and often sparse. This makes their classification more challenging, as models need to capture both the spatial geometry and the underlying relationships between points.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditional approaches use algorithms like PointNet++ and ModelNet, but optimizing these models often involves tedious trial-and-error with limited flexibility, as they rely on rigid rules for tuning parameters. Recently techniques like Cartesian genetic programming have been explored, but models evolve on pre-set rules without much flexibility or creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to use large language model (LLM) guided evolution to dynamically generate mutations and crossovers in the model's architecture. With our approach, we want to explore a vast design space to improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing algorithms.

        <h3 style="color: #50fa7b;">Optimizing Bistable Memory Sensors</h3>
        <p>
            Optimizing parameters of mechanical systems
        </p>
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
            <img src="{% static 'portfolio/spring.jpg' %}" alt="Description of the image" style="width: 600px; height: 300px; border-radius: 10px;">
        </div>
        <p>
            We work on optimizing the parameters of bistable memory sensors to enhance their performance and stability. These sensors can switch between two states based on applied forces, making them useful for a variety of applications in mechanical computing and smart materials.

        <h3 style="color: #50fa7b;">Exploring the Genetic Basis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</h3>
        <p>
            In high school, I was fortunate enough to work in a biomedical research lab where I conducted computational biology work.

        <p>
            My research focused on understanding the genetic factors associated with ASD, analyzing large datasets to identify significant genetic markers and patterns.
